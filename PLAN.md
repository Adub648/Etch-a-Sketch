Logic:
- For loop creates 16 iterations of a loop
- That loop inside the loop makes 16 divs in a row
- Inside each loop is a function that will create a div and position it accordingly

What am I up to?
- Trying to get the grid to display properly and to fit the rows inside the width
    - rem?

To do: 
- Make the actual pixel size of the grid relative
- Make squares fill whole grid
- Stop border disappearing with eraser
- Make buttons toggle properly
- Make it responsive
